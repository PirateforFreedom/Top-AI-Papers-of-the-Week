## Top AI Papers of the Week (July 22 - July 26) - 2024

| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1) **Distilling System 2 into System 1** -Since Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022), many such System 2 techniques have been proposed such as Rephrase and Respond (Deng et al., 2023a), System 2 Attention (Weston and Sukhbaatar, 2023) and Branch-Solve-Merge (Saha et al., 2023). In this work we investigate self-supervised methods to ``compile'' (distill) higher quality outputs from System 2 techniques back into LLM generations without intermediate reasoning token sequences, as this reasoning has been distilled into System 1. . | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06023)|

| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1) **LLMs Can't Plan, But Can Help Planning in LLM-Modulo Frameworks** -On one side are over-optimistic claims that LLMs can indeed do these tasks with just the right prompting or self-verification strategies. On the other side are perhaps over-pessimistic claims that all that LLMs are good for in planning/reasoning tasks are as mere translators of the problem specification from one syntactic format to another, and ship the problem off to external symbolic solvers. In this position paper, we take the view that both these extremes are misguided. We argue that auto-regressive LLMs cannot, by themselves, do planning or self-verification (which is after all a form of reasoning), and shed some light on the reasons for misunderstandings in the literature. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01817)|
| 2) **BioMedLM: A 2.7B Parameter Language Model Trained On Biomedical Text** -OHowever, these models have hundreds of billions of parameters, are computationally expensive to run, require users to send their input data over the internet, and are trained on unknown data sources. Can smaller, more targeted models compete? To address this question, we build and release BioMedLM, a 2.7 billion parameter GPT-style autoregressive model trained exclusively on PubMed abstracts and full articles. . | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18421)|
| 3) **Challenges in Deploying Long-Context Transformers: A Theoretical Peak Performance Analysis** Reducing the cost of long-context transformers is becoming a pressing research and engineering challenge starting from the year of 2024. This work describes a concurrent programming framework for quantitatively analyzing the efficiency challenges in serving multiple long-context requests under limited size of GPU high-bandwidth memory (HBM) regime. We give a detailed analysis of how all additional computational costs, compared to 4K context, trace back to \textit{one single source: the large size of the KV cache}. . | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08944)|
| 4) *How Do Large Language Models Acquire Factual Knowledge During Pretraining?**  there is a limited understanding of the mechanisms of how they acquire factual knowledge through pretraining. This work addresses this gap by studying how LLMs acquire factual knowledge during pretraining. The findings reveal several important insights into the dynamics of factual knowledge acquisition during pretraining. First, counterintuitively, we observe that pretraining on more data shows no significant improvement in the model's capability to acquire and maintain factual knowledge.  . | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11813)|








## Top AI Papers of the Week (July 8 - July 14) - 2024
| **Paper**  | **Links** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1) **FlashAttention-3** - proposes to adapt FlashAttention to take advantage of modern hardware; the techniques used to speed up attention on modern GPUs include producer-consumer asynchrony, interleaving block-wise matmul and softmax operations, and block quantization and incoherent processing; achieves speedup on H100 GPUs by 1.5-2.0x with FP16 reaching up to 740 TFLOPs/s (75% utilization), and with FP8 reaching close to 1.2 PFLOPs/s. | [Paper](https://tridao.me/publications/flash3/flash3.pdf), [Tweet](https://x.com/tri_dao/status/1811453622070444071) |
| 2) **RankRAG** - introduces a new instruction fine-tuning framework to perform effective context ranking and answering generation to enhance an LLM‚Äôs RAG capabilities; it leverages a small ranking dataset to outperform existing expert ranking models; shows that a Llama3-RankRAG significantly outperforms Llama3-ChatQA-1.5 and GPT-4 models on nine knowledge-intensive benchmarks.  | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02485v1), [Tweet](https://x.com/_weiping/status/1808551184309104896) |
| 3) **Mixture of A Million Experts** - introduces a parameter-efficient expert retrieval mechanism that leverages the product key technique for sparse retrieval from a million tiny experts; it attempts to decouple computational cost from parameter count by efficiently routing to a very large number of tiny experts through a learned index structure used for routing; demonstrates superior efficiency compared to dense FFW, coarse-grained MoEs, and Product Key Memory (PKM) layers.  | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04153), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1810389538340290724) |
| 4) **Reasoning in LLMs: A Geometric Perspective** - explores the reasoning of LLMs from a geometrical perspective; reports that a higher intrinsic dimension implies greater expressive capacity of the LLM; reports that they establish a connection between the expressive power of LLMs and the density of their self-attention graphs; their analysis demonstrates that the density of these graphs defines the intrinsic dimension of the inputs to the MLP blocks.  | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02678), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1810329294884741594) |
| 5) **Contextual Hallucinations Mitigation in LLMs** - proposes a new method that detects and significantly reduces contextual hallucinations in LLMs (e.g., reduces by 10% in the XSum summarization task); builds a hallucination detection model based on input features given by the ratio of attention weights on the context vs. newly generated tokens (for each attention head); the hypothesis is that contextual hallucinations are related to the extent to which an LLM attends to the provided contextual information; they also propose a decoding strategy based on their detection method which mitigates the contextual hallucination; the detector can also be transferred across models without the need for retraining. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07071), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1811072508637884750) |
| 6) **RouteLLM** - proposes efficient router models to dynamically select between stronger and weak LLMs during inference to achieve a balance between cost and performance; the training framework leverages human preference data and data augmentation techniques to boost performance; shows to significantly reduce costs by over 2x in certain cases while maintaining the quality of responses.  | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18665v2),  [Tweet](https://x.com/lmsysorg/status/1807812671238258931)  |
| 7) **A Survey on Mixture of Experts** - a survey paper on Mixture of Experts (MoE), including the technical details of MoE, open-source implementations, evaluation techniques, and applications of MoE in practice.  | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06204),  [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1811127876819026283)  |
| 8) **Internet of Agents** - a new framework to address several limitations in multi-agent frameworks such as integrating diverse third-party agents and adaptability to dynamic task requirements; introduces an agent integration protocol, instant messaging architecture design, and dynamic mechanisms for effective collaboration among heterogeneous agents.  | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07061v2),  [Tweet](https://x.com/_akhaliq/status/1810872693501157855)  |
| 9) **3DGen** - a new pipeline for end-to-end text-to-3D asset generation in under a minute; integrates state-of-the-art components like AssetGen and TextureGen to represent 3D objects in three ways, namely view space, in volumetric space, and in UV space; achieves a win rate of 68% with respect to the single-stage model.  | [Paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/meta-3d-gen/), [Tweet](https://x.com/AIatMeta/status/1808157832497488201)  |
| 10) **Learning at Test Time** - proposes new sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state; defines a hidden state as an ML model itself capable of updating even on test sequence; by a linear model and a two-layer MLP based hidden state is found to match or exceed baseline models like Transformers, Mamba, and modern RNNs; the linear model is faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04620), [Tweet](https://x.com/arankomatsuzaki/status/1810148710258508046) |
| 11) **Towards a Personal Health Large Language Model** - Here we present Personal Health Large Language Model (PH-LLM), fine-tuned from Gemini for understanding and reasoning over numerical time-series personal health data. We created and curated three datasets that test 1) production of personalized insights and recommendations from sleep patterns, physical activity, and physiological responses, 2) expert domain knowledge, and 3) prediction of self-reported sleep outcomes.   .   | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06474) |
| 12) **TextGrad: Automatic "Differentiation" via Text** - Inspired by this, we introduce TextGrad, a powerful framework performing automatic ``differentiation'' via text. TextGrad backpropagates textual feedback provided by LLMs to improve individual components of a compound AI system. In our framework, LLMs provide rich, general, natural language suggestions to optimize variables in computation graphs, ranging from code snippets to molecular structures. TextGrad follows PyTorch's syntax and abstraction and is flexible and easy-to-use. It works out-of-the-box for a variety of tasks, where the users only provide the objective function without tuning components or prompts of the framework. .  .   | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07496) |
| 13) **SelfGoal: Your Language Agents Already Know How to Achieve High-level Goals** - we present SelfGoal, a novel automatic approach designed to enhance agents' capabilities to achieve high-level goals with limited human prior and environmental feedback. The core concept of SelfGoal involves adaptively breaking down a high-level goal into a tree structure of more practical subgoals during the interaction with environments while identifying the most useful subgoals and progressively updating this structure. .   | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04784) |
| 14) **The Prompt Report: A Systematic Survey of Prompting Techniques** -While prompting is a widespread and highly researched concept, there exists conflicting terminology and a poor ontological understanding of what constitutes a prompt due to the area‚Äôs nascency. This paper establishes a structured understanding of prompts, by assembling a taxonomy of prompting techniques and analyzing their use. .   | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.06608v1) |

| 1) **Attention as an RNN** - ddressing this, we (1) begin by showing that attention can be viewed as a special Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the ability to compute its \textit{many-to-one} RNN output efficiently. We then (2) show that popular attention-based models such as Transformers can be viewed as RNN variants. However, unlike traditional RNNs (e.g., LSTMs), these models cannot be updated efficiently with new tokens, an important property in sequence modelling. Tackling this, we (3) introduce a new efficient method of computing attention's \textit{many-to-many} RNN output based on the parallel prefix scan algorithm. Building on the new attention formulation, we (4) introduce \textbf{Aaren}, an attention-based module that can not only (i) be trained in parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be updated efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like traditional RNNs)..   | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13956) |
| 2) **Not All Language Model Features Are Linear** -we explore whether some language model representations may be inherently multi-dimensional. We begin by developing a rigorous definition of irreducible multi-dimensional features based on whether they can be decomposed into either independent or non-co-occurring lower-dimensional features. Motivated by these definitions, we design a scalable method that uses sparse autoencoders to automatically find multi-dimensional features in GPT-2 and Mistral 7B. These auto-discovered features include strikingly interpretable examples, e.g. circular features representing days of the week and months of the year.   | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14860) |

HippoRAG synergistically orchestrates LLMs, knowledge graphs, and the Personalized PageRank algorithm to mimic the different roles of neocortex and hippocampus in human memory.  .   | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14831) |

First, a GNN reasons over a dense KG subgraph to retrieve answer candidates for a given question.  .   | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20139) |
| 9) **Transformers need glasses! Information over-squashing in language tasks** - We rely on a theoretical signal propagation analysis -- specifically, we analyse the representations of the last token in the final layer of the Transformer, as this is the representation used for next-token prediction. Our analysis reveals a representational collapse phenomenon: we prove that certain distinct sequences of inputs to the Transformer can yield arbitrarily close representations in the final token.   .   | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04267) |

We benchmark existing approaches to build this library and introduce model-based clustering, MBC, a method that groups tasks based on the similarity of their adapter parameters, indirectly optimizing for transfer across the multi-task dataset. To re-use the library, we present a novel zero-shot routing mechanism, Arrow, which enables dynamic selection of the most relevant adapters for new inputs without the need for retraining.

| 4) **Linearizing Large Language Models** we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06640)|

This design fosters the emergence of working memory within the Transformer, allowing it to process indefinitely long sequences. TransformerFAM requires no additional weights, enabling seamless integration with pre-trained models. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09173)|
| 3) **How Transformers Learn Causal Structure with Gradient Descent** - we introduce an in-context learning task that requires learning latent causal structure.

The key idea and primary advantage of GoT is the ability to model the information generated by an LLM as an arbitrary graph, where units of information ("LLM thoughts") are vertices, and edges correspond to dependencies between these vertices. This approach enables combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic outcomes, distilling the essence of whole networks of thoughts, or enhancing thoughts using feedback loops.  | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09687), [Code](https://github.com/spcl/graph-of-thoughts?tab=readme-ov-file) |

This framework employs neural displacement fields to convert letters into base shapes and applies per-frame motion, encouraging coherence with the intended textual concept. Shape preservation techniques and perceptual loss regularization are employed to maintain legibility and structural integrity throughout the animation process. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11614),  [code](https://github.com/zliucz/animate-your-word?tab=readme-ov-file)  |

| 9)  **OpenELM** - we release OpenELM, a state-of-the-art open language model. OpenELM uses a layer-wise scaling strategy to efficiently allocate parameters within each layer of the transformer model, leading to enhanced accuracy. For example, with a parameter budget of approximately one billion parameters, OpenELM exhibits a 2.36% improvement in accuracy compared to OLMo while requiring 2√ó fewer pre-training tokens.  | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14619), [code](https://github.com/apple/corenet)  |
